<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a final-year PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by <a href = "https://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/" target = "_blank">Dr. Eli Tilevich</a>. My research lies at the intersection of distributed systems, software engineering, and system support for machine learning. I build practical systems that enhance the reliability, interoperability, and performance of replicated data systems and domain-specific AI models.

Beyond my research, I also work as a <a href = "https://tlos.vt.edu/about/directory/personnel/mondal_p.html" target = "_blank">Graduate Application Developer</a> at Virginia Tech's Technology-enhanced Learning and Online Strategies (TLOS), where I enhance the university's Learning Management System by integrating an end-to-end AI pipeline. My work involves building RAG-based workflows and AI services using LangFlow and OpenAI, along with developing frontend features in React and Docker.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/srbd" target="_blank">Samsung Research Bangladesh</a>, contributing to the development of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications and improving real-time data synchronization for Samsung Notes. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/" target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>.
