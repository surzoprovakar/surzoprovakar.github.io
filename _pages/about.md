I am a fourth-year PhD student and <b>Graduate Research Assistant</b> in the <a href = "https://cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href = "https://vt.edu/" target="_blank"> Virginia Tech</a>. Under the supervision of <a href = "https://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/" target = "_blank">Dr.T.</a>, I conduct research in the <b>Software Innovations Lab</b>, focusing on the intersection of <b>Distributed Computing and Software Engineering</b>. My research aims to enhance <b>Software Engineering support for Replicated Data Systems</b>, addressing key challenges such as <b>error handling, integration testing, and cross-language interoperability</b>.<br><br> 

Before joining Virginia Tech, I worked as a full-time <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href = "https://research.samsung.com/srbd" target="_blank"> Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh (SRBD)</a>. Our team developed <a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide" target="_blank">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</a> applications, enabling functionality across Microsoft Windows devices, including PCs, tablets, smartphones, Xbox One, Microsoft HoloLens, and IoTs. Specifically, I engineered a <b>delta-data transferable middleware</b> for <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/samsung-notes/9nblggh43vhv?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank">Windows Samsung Notes</a>, optimizing synchronization latency and enabling real-time data synchronization with <a href = "https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-cloud" target="_blank">Samsung Cloud</a>.<br><br>

I have completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in <a href = "https://cse.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a> from <a href = "https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/" target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.</a> <br><br>

I love mountaineering, hiking, cycling, reading story books, and playing a lot of sports including Cricket, Tennis, Ping-pong, and Badminton.<br> <br>
