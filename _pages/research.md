Software Innovations Lab, led by Dr. Eli Tilevich, Virginia Tech
- Created a service-oriented middleware that enhances replicated data libraries with error-handling capabilities by <ins>25%</ins>, utilizing novel
integration techniques requiring no direct source code modification (Go, JavaScript, C#, and C++). <br>
- Introduced comprehensive integration testing support for replicated data libraries, increasing test coverage by <ins>32%</ins>, exercising exhaustive interleavings between libraries and application interactions (Go, Java, JavaScript, and Datalog). <br>
- Provided multilingual support for replicated data libraries to empower application developers to use the best programming language for application needs while ensuring compatibility and high performance by <ins>54%</ins> across platforms (Go, Java, JavaScript, and C++). <br>
- Assisted the Principal Investigator (PI) in submitting Grant Proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI).

<div style="text-align: justify">
Undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href = "https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rifat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a>. We devised a toolkit for AMD HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) accelerated processing units to leverage GPGPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units) libraries of high-level languages, such as APARAPI (A PARallel API) or TornadoVM. We translated the OpenCL file generated by such frameworks to HSA specific IR (Intermediate Representation) called HSAIL (Heterogeneous System Architecture Intermediate Language), which we then compiled into runnable BRIG format.
