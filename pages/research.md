## **Research**
My research interests are in the fields of Distributed System, Middleware, Software Engineering. I am also interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics, and Computational Physics.  <br> <br>


#### Research Experience
##### **Enabling GPGPU Frameworksfor HSA enabled APUs without Discrete GPU support**
Undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href = "https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rifat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a>. We devised a toolkit for AMD HSA accelerated processing units to leverage GPGPU libraries of high-level languages, such as APARAPI or TornadoVM. We translated the OpenCL file generated by such frameworks to HSA specific IR called HSAIL, which we then compiled into runnable BRIG format.
